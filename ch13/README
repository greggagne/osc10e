These files represent shared memory using the Windows API.

These programs can be compiled using an ordinary Windows development environment.

Ordinarily, when we have a producer-consumer paradigm, both processes are running
comcurrently. To simulate this, we have the producer enter a "while (1) ;"
loop so that it maintains running (there are other ways this could have been
accomplished, the while loop appears to be the simplest approach.)

To demonstrate this, start the producer process first, followed by the consumer.

It appears that some environments require having the file temp.txt in the same
directory as the producer program. We include a simple empty file for such
purposes.
