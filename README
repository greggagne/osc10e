Completing this project will require writing the following C files:

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.
