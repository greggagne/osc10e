Completing this project will require writing the following C files:

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

Each of these files will need to #include "schedulers.h"
and define add() and schedule() functions

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm.

run make to build all schedulers, run:

make

You can also build specific scheduler programs.
For example, to build the FCFS scheduler enter:

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.
